The SHA-256 algorithm is implemented in several steps:
Preprocessing: Pads the input message to ensure its length is a multiple of 512 bits.
Chunk Processing: Processes the message in 512-bit chunks, updating the hash value for each chunk.
Finalization: Produces the final 256-bit hash value.
The implementation closely follows the pseudocode structure.
